## Introduction

This backend service is using Laravel, so that we can make use of Eloquent and the Database Migration features of Laravel, among other shortcuts and automations, mostly due to time constraints.

For a more specific use-case (maybe when not using MySQL), then perhaps another programming language altogether would be a better choice.

Or if you want a much better performance, then maybe a compiled language like Golang, Java, Rust, etc would be the much better option for that kind of requirement, although the tooling would all be separated unlike what we have in Laravel.

## Project setup

```
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```
