# Introduction

The Frontend on this project is built using Vuetify. It has Vue.js and Material UI design inside, packaged using Vite.

This frontend needs access to the backend, so that it can send all its new records and have them all saved into the backend's database.

Please edit the `.env` file if needed, to point this frontend into the right location of its backend counterpart.

Thank you.
